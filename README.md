# chip-8 README

The following extension is a work-in-progress Chip-8 Language Extension, to allow for VS Code to support the Coding Language; Chip-8. And use localhost web-browser to run an emulator to run programs of said language.

## Usage

Download Latest extension version and check readme for new features.
- Current Instructions 

Create new file with ',,,.Ch8' filetype and project will recognize syntax. If not, bottom right Select 'UTF-8' and 'Chip-8' option should be available. 
Should now recognize Chip-8 OpCode commands.#

If wanting to run program roms, navigate back to extension download/update page. RIght side of read me, under Installation select blue link of "Size '...'". This'll open local directory of extension install. 
Locate 'Index-Emulator.html' and open in any chronium-based browser. This is, as of release, minmial Chip-8 emulator to run programs created with extension or other Roms. Programs created with this extension via VS code should work with any other Chip-8 emulator available.

- Above steps to be simplified into first VS Code command pallet Command. Then into intergrated GUI elements.
